3DFaciesModel proposes a new method to construct a three-dimensional (3D) facies model of an outcrop using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This method uses a 3D point cloud of an outcrop constructed by drone photogrammetry, which is effective even for large-scale or inaccessible outcrops.provides a method to establish 3D facies models using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
