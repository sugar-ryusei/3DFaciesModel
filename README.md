# 3DFaciesModel

3DFaciesModel proposes a new method to construct a 3D facies model of an outcrop using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on <a href="" target="_blank">Sato et al. (2025)</a>.

This method uses a 3D point cloud of an outcrop constructed by drone photogrammetry, which is effective even for large-scale or inaccessible outcrops.

Created by Ryusei Sato, <a href="https://researchmap.jp/k_kikuchi1020" target="_blank">Kazuki Kikuchi</a>, <a href=https://turbidite.secret.jp/>Hajime Naruse</a> from Kyoto University, Japan.

## Installation

The neural network model was built by Python version 3.9 with TensorFlow version 2.8.2 and Keras version 2.8.0.
